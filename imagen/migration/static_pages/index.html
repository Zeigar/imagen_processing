        <p>This web site serves the datasets collected and processed by the
           IMAGEN consortium in  >2.000 adolescents to study mental health in
           European youth and their parents. This includes demographics,
           neuropsychological assessments, medical questionnaires, MR
           neuroimaging and (gen)-omics. The different types of data were
           acquired for the baseline; some of them are longitudinal thanks to
           the follow-up 1 and follow-up 2.

           This server implements a data model that links the data entities together.
